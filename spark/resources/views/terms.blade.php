                    ANNEX
                    Service Level Terms
                    The Service’s customer service (hereinafter "Customer Service") shall be available during normal business hours (9am to 5pm) in Finland, excluding holidays and weekends and scheduled maintenance. If the Customer requests maintenance during these hours, any uptime or downtime calculation will exclude periods affected by such maintenance. Further, any downtime resulting from outages of third-party connections or utilities or other reasons beyond the Company’s control will also be excluded from any such calculation. The Customer's sole and exclusive remedy, and Company's entire liability, in connection with the Customer Service availability shall be that for each period of downtime lasting longer than one (1) hour, the Company will credit the Customer one (1) additional day of Service; provided that no more than one (1) such credit will accrue per day. Downtime shall begin to accrue as soon as the Customer (with notice to Company) recognizes that downtime is taking place and continues until the availability of the Service is restored. In order to receive downtime credit, the Customer must notify the Company in writing within seven (7) days from the time of downtime. Failure to provide such notice will forfeit the right to receive downtime credit. Such credits may not be redeemed for cash and shall not be cumulative beyond a total of credits for 20 additional days of Service in any one (1) calendar month in any event. The Company will apply the credit at the end of the current Term. Further, the Company will not grant a credit for any period in which the Customer received any Service free of charge. The Company’s blocking of data communications or other Service in accordance with its policies shall not be deemed to be a failure of the Company to provide adequate service levels under the Agreement.</div>
